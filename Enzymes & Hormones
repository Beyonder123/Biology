Enzymes - Summary
Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in the body without being consumed in the process. 
They are usually proteins and are highly specific to the reactions they catalyze.

Key Features:
Active Site: The region on the enzyme where the substrate binds.
Substrate: The molecule on which the enzyme acts.
Enzyme-Substrate Complex: Formed when the substrate binds to the active site.
Specificity: Each enzyme only catalyzes a specific reaction or group of reactions.
Temperature & pH: Enzyme activity is influenced by temperature and pH, with each enzyme having an optimal range.

Function:
Enzymes lower the activation energy required for reactions, making biochemical processes occur more efficiently. Examples include:
Amylase: Breaks down starch into sugars.
Lipase: Breaks down fats.

Hormones - Summary
Hormones are chemical messengers secreted by glands into the bloodstream, which regulate various physiological processes in the body.

Key Features:
Glands: Hormones are produced by endocrine glands like the thyroid, pancreas, and adrenal glands.
Target Cells: Hormones travel through the blood and act on specific target cells that have receptors for them.

Types:
Peptide Hormones: Made of amino acids (e.g., insulin).
Steroid Hormones: Derived from cholesterol (e.g., testosterone, estrogen).

Function:
Hormones control processes such as growth, metabolism, reproduction, and mood. Examples include:
Insulin: Regulates blood sugar levels.
Adrenaline: Increases heart rate and energy during stress.

Both enzymes and hormones are essential for maintaining homeostasis and regulating body functions.

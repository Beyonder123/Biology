Prokaryotic Cell - Summary
Prokaryotic cells are simple, single-celled organisms that lack a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles. They are typically smaller than eukaryotic cells and include bacteria and archaea.

Structure:
Nucleoid: Region where the cell's genetic material (DNA) is located, not enclosed in a membrane.
Plasma Membrane: Surrounds the cell and regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell.
Cell Wall: Provides structure and protection; made of peptidoglycan in bacteria.
Cytoplasm: Gel-like substance where cellular processes occur.
Ribosomes: Small structures that synthesize proteins.
Flagella: Tail-like structures used for movement (in some prokaryotes).
Pili: Hair-like projections that help in attachment to surfaces and DNA transfer.

Functions:
Genetic Information: DNA is stored in the nucleoid and controls cell functions.
Metabolism: Enzymes in the cytoplasm carry out metabolic processes like respiration and photosynthesis (in some bacteria).
Protein Synthesis: Ribosomes translate genetic instructions to make proteins.
Movement: Flagella allow the cell to move toward favorable environments.
Prokaryotic cells are vital in ecosystems, playing roles in decomposition, nitrogen fixation, and other processes.

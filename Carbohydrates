### **Carbohydrates - Summary**

**Carbohydrates** are organic molecules made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and are a primary source of energy for living organisms. They are classified into three types:

1. **Monosaccharides**: Simple sugars like glucose, fructose (found in fruits), and galactose.
2. **Disaccharides**: Formed by two monosaccharides, e.g., sucrose (table sugar) and lactose (milk sugar).
3. **Polysaccharides**: Long chains of monosaccharides, e.g., starch (in potatoes, rice), glycogen (energy storage in animals), and cellulose (in plant cell walls).

Carbohydrates are essential for energy production and are found in foods like bread, fruits, vegetables, and grains.

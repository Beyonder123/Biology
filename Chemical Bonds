Chemical Bonds - Summary
Chemical bonds are the forces that hold atoms together in compounds. The main types of chemical bonds include:

1. Ionic Bonds
Description: Formed when one atom transfers electrons to another, resulting in positively and negatively charged ions.
Example: Sodium chloride (NaCl) is formed when sodium (Na) donates an electron to chlorine (Cl). Sodium becomes Na⁺ and chlorine becomes Cl⁻, attracting each other due to opposite charges.
2. Covalent Bonds
Description: Formed when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons.
Example: Water (H₂O) consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom sharing electrons. Each hydrogen atom shares one electron with the oxygen atom, resulting in a stable molecule.

3. Polar Covalent Bonds
Description: A type of covalent bond where electrons are shared unequally, resulting in a molecule with a slight charge difference (dipole).
Example: In water (H₂O), oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, causing a partial negative charge near the oxygen and a partial positive charge near the hydrogens.

4. Metallic Bonds
Description: Occur between metal atoms, where electrons are pooled together in a "sea of electrons," allowing for conductivity and malleability.
Example: In metallic sodium (Na), sodium atoms share their valence electrons, resulting in a metallic lattice structure.
5. Hydrogen Bonds
Description: A weak bond that occurs when a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to an electronegative atom is attracted to another electronegative atom.
Example: Hydrogen bonds between water molecules contribute to water's unique properties, such as high surface tension and boiling point.

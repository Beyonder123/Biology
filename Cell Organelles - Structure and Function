### **Cell Organelles - Structure and Function**

1. **Nucleus**  
   - **Structure**: Surrounded by a double membrane (nuclear envelope) with nuclear pores. Contains chromatin (DNA) and a nucleolus.
   - **Function**: Controls cell activities and contains genetic material. The nucleolus is responsible for ribosome production.

2. **Mitochondria**  
   - **Structure**: Double membrane with inner folds called cristae. Has its own DNA.
   - **Function**: Produces energy (ATP) through cellular respiration. Known as the powerhouse of the cell.

3. **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)**  
   - **Structure**: Network of membranes; can be rough (with ribosomes) or smooth (without ribosomes).
   - **Function**: Rough ER synthesizes proteins, while Smooth ER synthesizes lipids and detoxifies substances.

4. **Golgi Apparatus**  
   - **Structure**: Stacks of membrane-bound sacs.
   - **Function**: Modifies, packages, and transports proteins and lipids.

5. **Ribosomes**  
   - **Structure**: Made of RNA and protein; can be free in the cytoplasm or attached to the ER.
   - **Function**: Synthesizes proteins by linking amino acids together.

6. **Lysosomes**  
   - **Structure**: Membrane-bound vesicles containing digestive enzymes.
   - **Function**: Breaks down waste materials, cellular debris, and foreign invaders.

7. **Chloroplasts** (Plant Cells)  
   - **Structure**: Double membrane with internal stacks of membranes called thylakoids. Contains chlorophyll.
   - **Function**: Site of photosynthesis, converting light energy into chemical energy (glucose).

8. **Vacuole**  
   - **Structure**: Large membrane-bound sac, more prominent in plant cells.
   - **Function**: Stores nutrients, waste products, and helps maintain cell rigidity in plants.

9. **Cell Membrane**  
   - **Structure**: Phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins.
   - **Function**: Controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell, providing protection and structure.

10. **Cell Wall** (Plant Cells)  
    - **Structure**: Rigid layer outside the cell membrane, made of cellulose in plants.
    - **Function**: Provides structural support and protection.

These organelles work together to maintain the cell's structure and perform essential functions like energy production, protein synthesis, and waste disposal.

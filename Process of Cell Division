Process of Cell Division
Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. It is essential for growth, development, 
and repair in multicellular organisms. There are two main types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis.

1. Mitosis
Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. 
It consists of several stages:

Prophase: Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes; the nuclear envelope breaks down; spindle fibers begin to form.
Metaphase: Chromosomes align at the cell's equatorial plane (metaphase plate).
Anaphase: Sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite poles of the cell.
Telophase: Chromatids reach the poles, and the nuclear envelope reforms around each set of chromosomes; chromosomes begin to de-condense.
Cytokinesis: The division of the cytoplasm, resulting in two separate daughter cells. In animal cells, this occurs through the formation of a cleavage furrow; in plant cells, a cell plate forms.

2. Meiosis
Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that occurs in germ cells to produce gametes (sperm and eggs) with half the number of chromosomes (haploid). 
It consists of two rounds of division: Meiosis I and Meiosis II.

Meiosis I:
Prophase I: Homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material (crossing over).
Metaphase I: Homologous pairs align at the metaphase plate.
Anaphase I: Homologous chromosomes are separated to opposite poles.
Telophase I: Nuclear envelope reforms around the two sets of chromosomes; cytokinesis occurs.

Meiosis II:
Similar to mitosis, where the sister chromatids are separated.
Results in four genetically diverse haploid cells.

Importance of Cell Division
Growth and Development: Enables organisms to grow and develop from a single fertilized egg into a multicellular organism.
Repair and Regeneration: Replaces damaged or dead cells.
Reproduction: Involves meiosis, leading to genetic diversity in offspring.

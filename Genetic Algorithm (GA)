### **Genetic Algorithm (GA) - Summary**

A **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** is an optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution.

#### **Key Components**:

1. **Population**: A group of potential solutions.
2. **Chromosome**: Representation of a solution, often as a string of numbers or binary digits.
3. **Fitness Function**: Evaluates how good each solution is.
4. **Selection**: Chooses the best solutions based on fitness for reproduction.
5. **Crossover**: Combines two solutions to create offspring.
6. **Mutation**: Randomly alters solutions to introduce variability.

#### **Process**:
1. Start with a random population.
2. Evaluate fitness of each solution.
3. Select the best solutions for crossover.
4. Perform crossover and mutation.
5. Repeat for several generations until a good solution is found.

This is how GAs mimic evolution to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems.

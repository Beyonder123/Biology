DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)
Structure: DNA is a double helix, consisting of two strands twisted around each other. 
          The backbone of each strand is made of alternating sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups. 

Function: DNA stores genetic information that directs the development, functioning, and reproduction of all living organisms. 
          It contains instructions for building proteins and is passed from one generation to the next.

Location: In eukaryotic cells, DNA is found in the nucleus. In prokaryotes, it is located in the nucleoid region.

RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)
Structure: RNA is usually single-stranded and made up of a sugar-phosphate backbone. The sugar in RNA is ribose.

Function: RNA plays various roles in the cell, mainly in protein synthesis:

mRNA (messenger RNA): Carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome.
tRNA (transfer RNA): Brings amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis.
rRNA (ribosomal RNA): Makes up the ribosome, where proteins are synthesized.

Location: RNA is found in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and ribosomes in eukaryotic cells.

Comparison:
DNA is the permanent genetic material, while RNA is more temporary and plays a role in expressing DNA instructions.
